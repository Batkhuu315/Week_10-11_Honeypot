# Objective

A honeypot is a decoy application, server, or other networked resource that intentionally exposes insecure features which, when exploited by an attacker, will reveal information about the methods, tools, and possibly even the identity of that attacker. Honeypots are commonly used by security researchers to understand the threat landscape facing developers and system administrators, collecting data.

Downloading the .json file was a bit complicated, not sure if it was becasue of my computer, or I was running the commands from the wrong instance. I needed more instructions and how to troubleshoot some errors. Luckily I got different instruction of how to download .json file from December 6th class. That is the reason why im submitting my assignment late. Otherwice instructions were easy to follow.
